# Longest Arithmetic Subsequence

Can you solve this real interview question? Longest Arithmetic Subsequence - Given an array nums of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in nums.

Note that:

 * A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
 * A sequence seq is arithmetic if seq[i + 1] - seq[i] are all the same value (for 0 <= i < seq.length - 1).

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3, 6, 9, 12]

Output: 4

Explanation: The whole array is already an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3, so the longest arithmetic subsequence is [3, 6, 9, 12], of length 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [9, 4, 7, 2, 10]

Output: 3

Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [4, 7, 10] (indices 1, 2, 4), with a common difference of 3. There is no arithmetic subsequence of length 4.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [20, 1, 15, 3, 10, 5, 8]

Output: 4

Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [20, 15, 10, 5] (indices 0, 2, 4, 5), with a common difference of -5.
